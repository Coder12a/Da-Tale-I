Dr. Penguins lives in Antarctica, but has been recruited by the KGB to do research and spy work there.
When the KGB learns about killer-bunnies with laser eyes infecting Europe and Asia, they call Dr. Penguins up to Russia to work on the case, because he's one of the most experienced researchers that is in their group. Upon arriving in Russia, he meets a young, very strong bear named Vladimir Grabinski who is looking for an adventure.
He recruits the bear to help him, and as they travel into Asia the bear slowly learns who Dr. Penguins really is.
By the time they fight their way to China, the killer bunnies are hunting them down. They manage to hide their identity and sneak into China unbeknownst to the bunnies.
In eastern China they meet an old ape who is a tea farmer. The ape's brother lives nearby, but not even Dr. Penguins knows that he has a feud with the tea farmer, nor that he's working for their real enemy: Wesley.
The coffee farmer betrays them, and the killer bunnies ambush them in the hills. The tea farmer uses his ladrahasla skills to save them from the sudden ambush, but weakens himself so that he gets sick and dies.
The coffee farmer then attacks Vladimir and Dr. Penguin, causing a huge fight to ensue in which the coffee farmer's wand, the Mese Crystalis, made by dwarves on Mount Boom, gets broken.
The energy released from the breaking of the wand wakes up Yoda the Frog, who was hibernating at the bottom of Mount Boom Lake. He joins the two heros and sails with them across the Pacific.
